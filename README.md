Recommendation System in Python
This repository contains an implementation of a Recommendation System in Python.

ðŸ“‹ Overview

A Recommendation System is a machine learning model designed to suggest relevant items to users by analyzing their preferences, history, and behavior. This project demonstrates the basics of building such systems using Python and its libraries.

ðŸ’¡ Features

Data Loading: Utilizes a sample dataset to simulate a recommendation scenario.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items based on their features and similarity to user preferences.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests items based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.

Evaluation Metrics: Measures system performance using various metrics.

ðŸ”§ Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
  
  Python 3.7 or above
  
  Pandas
  
  NumPy
  
  Scikit-learn
  
  Matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)
  
Install the dependencies using pip

Clone the repository

Run the Python script

Follow the output in the console to see the recommended items.


ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements

Extend support for hybrid recommendation systems.
Implement advanced algorithms like matrix factorization and neural network-based recommenders.
Integrate with a web application for a complete end-to-end solution.
